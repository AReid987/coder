We scale-test Coder with [a built-in utility](#scale-testing-utility) that can
be used in your environment for insights into how Coder scales with your
infrastructure. For scale-testing Kubernetes clusters we recommend to install
and use the dedicated Coder template,
[scaletest-runner](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/scaletest/templates/scaletest-runner).

Learn more about [Coderâ€™s architecture](../about/architecture.md) and our
[scale-testing methodology](architectures/index.md#scale-testing-methodology).
